# MySQL-Log-Analysis-Network-Oriented-Practice


This project is a hands-on practice focused on SQL fundamentals applied to log analysis and basic security monitoring.
The goal is not to build an application, but to understand how database queries can be used to analyze activity logs, similar to what is done in system administration or SOC environments.

All work is done using MySQL on Linux, through the command line.



## What This Project Covers

Designing simple log-oriented tables

Writing SQL queries to analyze user activity

Detecting suspicious patterns such as repeated failed logins

Understanding logs from a network and security perspective




## Database Structure (Simplified)

users

Stores basic user identity information.

id, username, role, created_at

logs

Stores activity logs generated by users.

id, user_id, activity, ip_address, created_at

The logs table is designed to resemble real-world system or authentication logs.




## Key SQL Queries

Detect repeated failed login attempts

SELECT ip_address, COUNT(*) AS total_attempts
FROM logs
WHERE activity = 'login_failed'
GROUP BY ip_address
HAVING total_attempts >= 5;

This query is used to identify IP addresses that show brute-force–like behavior by repeatedly failing login attempts.



View recent activity with user context

SELECT u.username, l.activity, l.ip_address, l.created_at
FROM logs l
JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY l.created_at DESC;

This helps correlate user identities with their activities, which is common in log investigation.



## Daily activity summary

SELECT DATE(created_at) AS log_date, COUNT(*) AS total_logs
FROM logs
GROUP BY log_date;

Useful for understanding traffic patterns and activity volume over time.



## Why This Project Exists

Most beginner projects focus only on CRUD operations.
This project instead focuses on how SQL is actually used to read and interpret logs, which is a common task in backend systems, infrastructure, and security operations.

The emphasis is on:

Clarity over complexity

Practical queries over theory

Understanding why a query is written, not just how



## Environment

OS: Linux Database: MySQL

Interface: Command Line (CLI)

Language: SQL

Notes

This project is intentionally kept simple.
The goal is to build strong fundamentals before moving on to larger systems such as log pipelines, SIEM tools, or visualization platforms.
